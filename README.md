## Requirements
- Access to a command-line interface
- Python version 3.12 installed on your personal machine

## File Format
Using the example-equations1.txt as an example, make sure your every mathematical equation in your eqaution files are formatted like this:
<pre> <equation> <equation> <equation> <pre>


## Usage
Simply type the following in your UNIX command-line to run the python script:
<br> 
<pre> python3 calculate_equation_from_file.py <provided .txt file with equations> <pre>

For example, using the example files provided in this repo, a practical example would look something like this:
<br> 
<pre> python3 calculate_equation_from_file.py example-equations1.txt <pre>
